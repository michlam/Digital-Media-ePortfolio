<p>Born in the cityscapes of Hong Kong, I was always close to the action. Being raised in a major financial and technological hub, technology had a significant impact on my childhood. Perhaps that's why I love playing around with computers in my free time. When I'm at my desk, I'm normally just having fun with Adobe Photoshop or Autodesk Maya. Otherwise, I'm either reading, running, playing music, or contemplating the secrets of the universe. In other words, I'm constantly growing.</p>

<p>In 2010, I immigrated to Canada. To me, this new country was a brand new world to draw inspiration from, with a drastically different environment and lifestyle. Every step had a hint of nature embedded into it, and I try to represent this influence in my art by encorporating a harmonious and natural feel to my works.</p>

<p>I spent my entire high school life in Canada, and I am currently in Grade 11. I am enrolled in the French Immersion program, and am also learning Japanese. However, even if my love for the arts is unrequited, I also enjoy and excel in the sciences and maths. Outside of the classroom, I'm also in charge of the Fruit and Veggies Club and led the Interact Project <em>Valentine's For Veterans</em>, which was able to raise over 600 dollars for veterans all around Canada. Furthermore, I participate in volunteer opportnities hosted by the Natural Club and Student Council.</p>
	
<p>For the longest time, my plans for the future had been undecided. It was not as if I was passionless; rather, I wanted to do a little bit of everything. To be honest, I still do, but choices had to be made, and I realized that I enjoy working with computers, whether it be for programming or art. And as post-secondary life looms before me, I can't wait to learn more and to hone my skills. There's still so much out there for me to explore. The world awaits. </p>
